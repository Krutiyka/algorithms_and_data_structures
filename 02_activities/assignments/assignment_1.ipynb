    "The solution works by leveraging the properties of sets to efficiently identify the missing numbers from a given list. \n",

    "1. Understanding the Problem:\n",
    "\t- We need to find numbers that are missing from the list nums in the range [0, n], where n is the length of the list.\n",
    "\t- The list nums may contain duplicates and numbers within the range [0, n].\n",
    "2. Approach:\n",
    "\t- Full Range Set: Create a set called full_set containing all integers from 0 to n. This represents all possible numbers that should be present.\n",
    "\t- Unique Numbers Set: Convert the input list nums to a set called num_set to eliminate duplicates and represent the unique numbers present in the list.\n",
    "\t- Difference of Sets: Calculate the difference between full_set and num_set. This difference will give us the set of numbers that are missing from the list.\n",
    "\t- Sorting and Return: Convert the difference set to a sorted list to maintain the order and return it. If no numbers are missing, return [-1].\n",
    "3. Correctness:\n",
    "\t- Full Range Coverage: By creating full_set, we ensure that all numbers from 0 to n are considered.\n",
    "\t- Handling Duplicates: Converting nums to a set num_set ensures that duplicates are removed and we only consider unique numbers.\n",
    "\t- Accurate Missing Numbers: The set difference operation accurately identifies which numbers are missing from the list."

    "\t-Iterate through the list nums and calculate the sum of all its elements. This is the actual sum of the numbers present in the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "\t- To find the missing numbers, compare the expected_sum with the actual_sum.\n",
    "\t- The difference between the expected_sum and actual_sum gives us a single missing number, but since there can be multiple missing numbers, we need to be a bit more elaborate:\n",
