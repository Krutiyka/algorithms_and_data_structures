    "\t\tTime Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the is_duplicate function can be analyzed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. Tree Traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t- The function performs a level-order traversal (BFS) of the binary tree, visiting each node exactly once.\n",
    "\t\t- If there are n nodes in the tree, the traversal requires O(n) time to visit all nodes.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t2. Duplicate Check and Set Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t- For each node, the function checks if the node's value is in the set seen and possibly adds it to the set.\n",
    "\t\t- Checking for the existence of an element in a set and adding an element to a set both have an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Since both the traversal and the set operations are efficient, the overall time complexity \n",
    "is dominated by the traversal, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tSpace Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the is_duplicate function is determined by the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. Queue (for BFS traversal):\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t- The queue is used to store nodes at each level during the traversal.\n",
    "\t\t- In the worst case, the queue can hold all the nodes at the maximum level of the tree. \n",
    "        For a balanced binary tree, the maximum number of nodes at the last level is about n/2.\n",
    "\t\t- Therefore, the space required for the queue is O(n) in the worst case.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t2. Set (to track seen values):\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t- The set seen stores the values of the nodes encountered during the traversal.\n",
    "\t\t- In the worst case, where all node values are unique, the set will store n values.\n",
    "\t\t- Thus, the space required for the set is O(n).\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Combining these factors, the overall space complexity of the function is O(n), considering both the queue and the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tSummary\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. \n",
    "    This is due to the level-order traversal that visits each node once.\n",
    "\t- Space Complexity: O(n), accounting for the storage required by the queue and the set, \n",
    "    both of which can grow to store up to n elements in the worst case.\n",
